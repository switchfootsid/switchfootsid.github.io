Effective writing is often elusive. Not necessarily because the writer has a fuzzy thought process but because there’s tension between capturing the optimal level of detail, managing style and quality. How do you weigh each aspect while communicating an important idea?

One of my longtime mentors, had an interesting take on writing for the internet. He posited writing in the modern day shouldn’t be viewed as a unidirectional transfer of information from the speaker to the reader but as a circular loop. It begins with the writer’s message, the message hits the reader, elucidates a response which is fed back to the writer. Now the second time this loop runs it must facilitate a more efficient flow of information. 

A promising start would be to understand the target audience for a blog. For most of my writing this is largely deterministic: developers interested in marrying concepts of applied machine learning with timeless principles of system design. Another set of qualititative reality for readers of any technology blog today is as follows: 
* They're time-constrained and often looking to squeeze that hour of learning into their busy schedule
* They’re content driven and just need a framework to learn
* They’re looking for actionable solutions
 
With that in in mind, I write for enthusiasts with busy schedules looking to build large-scale ML systems, my writing presents a distillation of some practical concepts and strategies I’ve learnt along the way through my interaction with terrific engineers at Google and running many failed experiments. 

But beyond that, this blog is a commitment to distilling and deepening my own understanding of self and subject matter both. Like most of my personal writing, I diverge and expound on concepts from books, technology strategy and the art of learning.
