title: About Me
---

My name is Siddharth Kotwal and I am Machine Learning Lead based in Toronto, Canada. Specifically interested in picking arcane ML research, engineering a real-world solution around it and making it achieve commercial success for the enterprise. My current area of focus is architecting robust, reliable and scalable machine learning systems that help in powering intelligent products like crowd analytics, video surveillance and visual search.

Currently working as a Solutions Architect at [Quantiphi Inc](https://www.quantiphi.com/) where my work spans collaborating with clients to build product roadmaps, designing ML experiments and systems for serving models in production.

I strive for the happiness of pursuit, following my own intellectual curiosity and applying Andy Grove's management philosophy to building better engineering organizations. All of my free time is consumed by reading books, spinning old grunge rock records and training at [Krudar Muay Thai](http://www.krudar.com/).
